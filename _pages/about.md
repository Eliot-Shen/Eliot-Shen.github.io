## 🔎  About Me
I'm a 3rd-year undergraduate student at [East China Normal University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), majoring in Software Engineering.
I am currently a research intern at the Mobile Visual Computing Lab, advised by Prof. Shaohui Lin. 
My research interests include Multi-modal Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and AI Safety.

Outside of research, I am passionate about sports, especially football, table tennis, and tennis. 
I currently serve as the captain of the ECNU School of Software Engineering Football Team, where I lead training sessions and matches.

Feel free to contact me if interest.

## 📝 Research
- **DF-LLaVA: Unlocking MLLM's potential for Synthetic Image Detection via Prompt-Guided Knowledge Injection** **[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14957">arXiv</a>]**  <br>
  *Preprint, submitted to ICASSP 2026.* <br>
  This project proposes DF-LLaVA, a simple yet effective framework that enhances multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for interpretable synthetic image detection. By extracting latent discriminative knowledge from MLLMs and reinjecting it into training via prompt-based guidance, DF-LLaVA unlocks the model’s intrinsic capability to assess image authenticity with both high accuracy and human interpretability. Compared to existing binary or probability-based detectors, DF-LLaVA not only outperforms expert models in detection accuracy but also preserves the explanatory reasoning advantages of MLLMs, achieving a strong balance between precision and transparency in synthetic image forensics.
